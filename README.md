## Arches to the Infirmary

Arches to the Infirmary is a third-person action-adventure game prototype developed in Unity. The project focuses on implementing core gameplay systems such as player movement, combat, enemy behaviour, UI, and interactive environments across multiple levels.
This project was created as part of a Game Design & Development university module, with an emphasis on gameplay programming and system integration.

# Gameplay Overview

The player explores a haunted hospital environment inspired by the Worcester Infirmary. Progression is achieved by locating pressure plates that unlock doors, avoiding or defeating enemies, and navigating through teleporters to reach the next stage.
The game features increasing difficulty across levels, encouraging exploration, combat, and interaction with the environment.

# Key Features

Multi-level gameplay with increasing difficulty
Physics-based player movement using Rigidbody controls
Enemy AI with detection, pursuit, and attack behaviours
Player and enemy health systems with UI health bars
Combat mechanics, including standard and spin attacks
Interactive environments (pressure plates, animated doors, teleporters)
Collectible system with score tracking
Settings menu allowing persistent player colour customisation

# Systems & Mechanics Implemented
Player Systems
Keyboard and mouse input handling
Physics-based movement and collision
Health management with HUD integration
Weapon-based combat using animations
Enemy Systems
Proximity-based enemy detection
Attack behaviours driven by Unity’s Animator
Individual enemy health bars
Environment & Progression
Trigger-based pressure plates controlling animated doors
Teleporters used for level transitions
Collectible coins contributing to player score
UI & Persistence

# Technologies Used

Unity
C#
Unity Animator
Rigidbody Physics

# Limitations & Future Improvements

This project was developed as a prototype and has areas for improvement, including:
Expanding enemy AI behaviour (patrol states, smarter combat logic)
Improving camera and combat animations
Adding a full inventory system
Refactoring systems to improve modularity and scalability
